# Queries

Iroha queries read ledger state without mutating it. The current data model
exposes two broad query shapes:

- **singular queries**, which return one object or one value
- **iterable queries**, which return a stream or collection and can be combined
  with filtering, sorting, projection, and pagination where the query type
  supports it

Use SDK typed builders or the CLI instead of constructing query envelopes by
hand. The names below are the current query types exposed by
`iroha_data_model::query`.

## Filtering and Pagination

Iterable queries can expose predicate and selector support. Use query-specific
typed filters from the SDK so the filter input matches the query output type.
For large result sets, use query parameters such as cursor and limit instead
of fetching every row at once.
