# Torii Endpoints

Torii is the HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket gateway for Iroha 3. It serves both
ledger-facing APIs and operator endpoints.

The current protocol rules are:

- the canonical binary format is **Norito**
- many endpoints also support JSON when you send `Accept: application/json`
- metrics are exposed in Prometheus format

For format details, content negotiation, layout flags, schema hashes, and
Norito RPC guidance, see the [Norito reference](/reference/norito.md).

## Common Endpoints

| Endpoint | Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /transaction` | Norito | Submit a signed transaction |
| `POST /query` | Norito | Submit a signed query |
| `GET /events` | WebSocket | Subscribe to event streams |
| `GET /block/stream` | WebSocket | Stream committed blocks |
| `GET /peers` | JSON | Peer list exposed by Torii |
| `GET /health` | JSON | Lightweight liveness endpoint |
| `GET /api_version` | JSON | Default API version |
| `GET /status` | JSON | High-level status summary for operators |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus | Prometheus scrape endpoint |
| `GET /schema` | JSON | Data-model schema snapshot served by the node |
| `GET /openapi` or `GET /openapi.json` | JSON | OpenAPI document for the active Torii HTTP routes |
| `GET /v1/parameters` | JSON | Node parameter snapshot |
| `GET /v1/node/capabilities` | JSON | Node capability and data-model metadata |
| `GET /v1/api/versions` | JSON | Supported Torii API versions |
| `GET /v1/events/sse` | SSE | Event stream for long-lived clients |
| `GET /v1/time/now` | JSON | Node wall-clock snapshot |
| `GET /v1/time/status` | JSON | Time synchronization status |

`/openapi` is the authoritative endpoint list for a running node. The exact
surface depends on build features and runtime configuration, so generated
clients should prefer the live OpenAPI document over a hand-copied route list.
Use the [Torii API console](/reference/torii-api-console.md) to load that live
document, test JSON routes, copy curl requests, and generate client code from
the current schema.

## Try Live Taira Routes

The public Taira testnet exposes the same Torii JSON surface that application
clients use for read-only exploration. These commands do not require keys:

```bash
TAIRA_ROOT=https://taira.sora.org

curl -fsS "$TAIRA_ROOT/status" \
  | jq '{blocks, txs_approved, txs_rejected, queue_size, peers}'

curl -fsS "$TAIRA_ROOT/openapi.json" \
  | jq -r '.paths | keys[]' \
  | grep '^/v1/' \
  | head -n 20

curl -fsS "$TAIRA_ROOT/v1/node/capabilities" \
  | jq '{abi_version, data_model_version, query: .query.aggregate.supported_resources}'
```

Try resource reads against the current world state:

```bash
curl -fsS "$TAIRA_ROOT/v1/domains?limit=5" \
  | jq -r '.items[].id'

curl -fsS "$TAIRA_ROOT/v1/assets/definitions?limit=5" \
  | jq -r '.items[] | [.id, .name, .total_quantity] | @tsv'
```

If a public testnet route returns `502`, times out, or reports a saturated
queue, treat it as an endpoint availability issue and retry later before
debugging your client code.

## Consensus and Runtime Endpoints

## App and SORA Route Families

When Torii is built with the app-facing feature set, it exposes additional JSON
families for explorers, SORA services, bridge flows, proofs, and storage. These
families are not all enabled on every network profile.

| Route family | Purpose |

| `/v1/kaigi/*`, `/v1/webhooks/*`, `/v1/notify/*`, `/v1/telemetry/*` | Collaboration, webhook, push notification, and live telemetry integrations |

## ISO 20022 Bridge

Torii exposes the ISO 20022 bridge under `/v1/iso20022/*` when the app-facing
API and bridge runtime are enabled. The bridge is intentionally scoped: it is
not a general-purpose ISO 20022 clearing gateway, but a supported subset for
turning selected payment messages into signed Iroha transfers and for tracking
their ledger status.

### Torii ISO 20022 Endpoints

| Method and endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/pacs008` | Submit an FI-to-FI customer credit transfer and build the matching Iroha asset transfer |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/pacs009` | Submit an FI-to-FI credit transfer used for PvP or securities-related cash funding |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/pacs002` | Submit a payment status report |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/pacs004` | Submit a payment return |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/camt056` | Submit a payment cancellation request |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/sese023` | Submit a securities settlement instruction |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/sese024` | Submit a securities settlement status message |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/sese025` | Submit a securities settlement confirmation |
| `POST /v1/iso20022/colr012` | Submit a collateral substitution message |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}` | Read the canonical bridge record for one message |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/audit/messages` | Read the tamper-evident message audit manifest |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/pacs002` | Render the current payment status as `pacs.002` XML |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/pacs004` | Render the current payment return as `pacs.004` XML |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/camt029` | Render the current cancellation resolution as `camt.029` XML |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/sese024` | Render the current settlement status as `sese.024` XML |
| `GET /v1/iso20022/messages/{msg_id}/sese025` | Render the current settlement confirmation as `sese.025` XML |

`pacs.008` submissions must provide the message ID, interbank settlement
amount, currency, settlement date, debtor and creditor IBANs, and debtor and
creditor BICs. When reference data is configured, the bridge also checks the
BIC, IBAN, and ISO 4217 currency crosswalks before the generated transaction
enters the pipeline.

`pacs.009` submissions must provide the business message ID, message definition
ID, creation time, interbank settlement amount, currency, settlement date,
instructing and instructed agent BICs, and debtor and creditor IBANs. If the
message includes `Purp`, the bridge currently accepts securities-purpose funding
only: `Purp=SECU`.

The `pacs.008` and `pacs.009` submission endpoints accept XML ISO envelopes or
the flat field format used by the bridge tests. Optional `SplmtryData` fields
can pin the target Iroha ledger, source and target account IDs or addresses,
and asset definition ID. The response is `202 Accepted` with `message_id`,
`transaction_hash`, `status`, `pacs002_code`, and the resolved
ledger/account/asset context.

### Additional Parser and Mapping Support

The IVM ISO helper also validates and materializes the following message
families for envelope validation, settlement mapping, or downstream
reconciliation. They do not have standalone Torii routes.

| Message family | Current support |
| --- | --- |
| `head.001` | Business application header validation for ISO envelopes, including `BizMsgIdr`, `MsgDefIdr`, creation time, and optional sender/receiver BIC fields |
| `pacs.007`, `pacs.028`, `pacs.029` | Payment reversal, status request, and investigation resolution/status parsing |
| `pain.001`, `pain.002` | Customer payment initiation and payment status report validation |
| `camt.052`, `camt.053`, `camt.054` | Account report, statement, and notification validation |

## Kaigi Sessions

Kaigi provides paid, real-time audio/video rooms on SORA Nexus. Use it when
an application needs ledger-backed session creation, roster changes, relay
manifests, encrypted signaling, and usage metering instead of keeping all
conferencing state off-chain.

The ledger-facing lifecycle is:

- `CreateKaigi`: create a call under a domain and store its policy,
  schedule, metadata, and optional relay manifest.
- `JoinKaigi` and `LeaveKaigi`: update the call roster. In private mode,
  participants use commitments, nullifiers, and roster proofs instead of
  exposing participant account IDs directly.
- `RecordKaigiUsage`: append metered duration and gas totals.
- `EndKaigi`: close the session and record the final timestamp.

Torii exposes relay telemetry under `/v1/kaigi/relays`,
`/v1/kaigi/relays/{relay_id}`, `/v1/kaigi/relays/health`, and
`/v1/kaigi/relays/events` when the app API and telemetry features are enabled.
Session state is reflected through Kaigi domain events such as
`KaigiRosterSummary`, `KaigiRelayManifestUpdated`,
`KaigiRelayHealthUpdated`, and `KaigiUsageSummary`.

### CLI Smoke Test

Start with the `iroha kaigi` CLI when you want to verify that a Torii endpoint
accepts Kaigi transactions before connecting a UI. The quickstart command
creates a temporary room against the active Torii endpoint and prints a summary
with the call identifier, join command, and SoraNet spool hint:

```bash
iroha kaigi quickstart --auto-join-host --summary-out kaigi-summary.json
```

For scripted flows, manage the room lifecycle explicitly:

```bash
iroha kaigi create \
  --domain streaming \
  --call-name daily \
  --host <i105-account-id> \
  --privacy-mode transparent \
  --room-policy authenticated

iroha kaigi join --domain streaming --call-name daily --participant <i105-account-id>
iroha kaigi leave --domain streaming --call-name daily --participant <i105-account-id>

iroha kaigi record-usage \
  --domain streaming \
  --call-name daily \
  --duration-ms 120000 \
  --billed-gas 1500

iroha kaigi end --domain streaming --call-name daily
```

Use `--room-policy public` for rooms that relays may expose without viewer
tickets, or `--room-policy authenticated` when exits must require viewer
authentication. Use `--privacy-mode zk-roster-v1` only after the network has
the Kaigi roster and usage verifying keys configured; otherwise joins, leaves,
and private usage records fail during deterministic verification.

### Testing With the JavaScript Demo

Use the
[soramitsu/iroha-demo-javascript](https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-demo-javascript)
desktop demo for an end-to-end wallet test. The demo is an Electron and Vue
application that talks directly to Torii through the local `@iroha/iroha-js`
binding and includes a `/kaigi` route for browser-native one-to-one media.

Use the demo with
[`@iroha/iroha-js`](https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha/tree/main/javascript/iroha_js)
from the Iroha source repository. The demo pins the SDK through
`file:../iroha/javascript/iroha_js`, so keep both checkouts in this sibling
layout:

```bash
mkdir iroha-wallet-workspace
cd iroha-wallet-workspace
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger-iroha/iroha.git
git clone https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-demo-javascript.git

cd iroha/javascript/iroha_js
npm install
npm run build:native
npm run build:dist

cd ../../../iroha-demo-javascript
npm install
npm run dev
```

Use Node.js 20 or newer and a Rust toolchain so the native `iroha_js_host`
module can build. Rebuild the SDK in the sibling Iroha checkout after changing
its source; the clean package layout does not contain the Cargo workspace
needed by `npm run build:native`.

For a controlled test, point the demo at a Kaigi-capable Torii endpoint:

1. Start an Iroha node with the SORA/Kaigi app-facing APIs enabled, or use a
   public endpoint that exposes the Kaigi surfaces you need.
2. Check basic reachability with `/health`, then check the live route surface
   with `/openapi` or `/openapi.json`. Some deployments also expose
   `/v1/health`, but `/health` is the portable liveness check.
3. For TAIRA, verify the relay telemetry routes before trying a live meeting:

   ```bash
   TAIRA=https://taira.sora.org
   curl -fsS "$TAIRA/health"
   curl -fsS "$TAIRA/v1/kaigi/relays"
   curl -fsS "$TAIRA/v1/kaigi/relays/health"
   ```

   These checks prove that Torii and Kaigi relay telemetry are reachable. They
   do not create a meeting; `CreateKaigi` and `JoinKaigi` still need funded
   wallets and signed transaction submission.
4. Open the demo, go to **Settings**, set the Torii URL, and let the app load
   the chain ID and network prefix from the endpoint.
5. Create or restore two local wallets in the demo. Use separate app windows,
   profiles, or machines so the host and guest have separate wallet state.

To test the Kaigi UI:

1. In the host window, open **Kaigi**, choose **Start meeting**, set a title,
   and choose **Private invite** or **Transparent invite**.
2. Select **Turn on camera and mic** so WebRTC has local media.
3. Select **Create meeting link**. A live wallet submits `CreateKaigi`; the
   app then shows an `iroha://kaigi/join?call=...&secret=...` invite and a
   `#/kaigi?...` fallback route.
4. Keep the host window open and share the invite with the guest.
5. In the guest window, open the invite or paste it in **Join meeting**, turn
   on local media, and select **Join meeting**. A live wallet fetches the
   encrypted host offer from Torii and submits `JoinKaigi` with encrypted
   answer metadata.
6. The host should auto-apply the first answer by streaming or polling Kaigi
   call signals. Both windows should show connected media and updated
   connection details.
7. End the session from the host, or use the CLI `iroha kaigi end` command for
   the same call ID.

Private Kaigi needs shielded XOR to pay the private entrypoint fee. If the
demo reports that private Kaigi needs shielded XOR, use the in-app
self-shield prompt and retry the create or join action. If proof generation,
private funding, or live signaling is unavailable, the demo can fall back to a
transparent/manual flow. In that case, open **Advanced signaling**, copy the
raw offer or answer packet, and paste it into the other window.

For automated checks in the demo repo, run:

```bash
npm test -- tests/kaigiView.spec.ts tests/preloadKaigiBridge.spec.ts
npm run e2e:ui
npm run verify
```

The focused Vitest suites cover Kaigi meeting-link creation, compact invite
loading, private create/join/end bridge calls, self-shield prompts, manual
fallbacks, and answer polling. The UI smoke test includes the `/kaigi` route
on desktop and mobile-sized viewports. Live media between two wallets still
needs a manual two-window test because browser camera/microphone permissions
and peer media streams are environment-specific.

For sample integration code, see
[Embed Kaigi in a JavaScript App](/guide/tutorials/kaigi.md).

## Status and Metrics

The status and metrics endpoints are the first things to wire into dashboards:

- `/status` exposes top-level peer, block, queue, and consensus fields
- `/metrics` exposes Prometheus counters, gauges, and histograms

On Nexus-enabled nodes, status output also includes lane and data-space-aware
sections. When `nexus.enabled = false`, those sections are omitted.

## JSON vs. Norito

Several operator endpoints return Norito by default. When the endpoint supports
JSON, send:

```http
Accept: application/json
```

This is especially useful for:

- `/v1/sumeragi/status`
- `/v1/sumeragi/qc`
- `/v1/sumeragi/commit_qc/{hash}`

When an endpoint accepts or returns typed Norito directly, use
`application/x-norito` as the content type or preferred `Accept` value. See
[Norito](/reference/norito.md#torii-and-norito-rpc) for the transport details.

## Telemetry Profiles

Endpoint visibility depends on telemetry settings. The upstream docs describe
five profile levels:

| Profile | `/status` | `/metrics` | Developer routes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `disabled` | no | no | no |
| `operator` | yes | no | no |
| `extended` | yes | yes | no |
| `developer` | yes | no | yes |
| `full` | yes | yes | yes |

## CLI Shortcuts

The `iroha` CLI already wraps many of these endpoints:

```bash
iroha --config ./localnet/client.toml --output-format text ops sumeragi status
iroha --config ./localnet/client.toml --output-format text ops sumeragi phases
iroha --config ./localnet/client.toml ops sumeragi params
iroha --config ./localnet/client.toml --output-format text ops sumeragi telemetry
```
