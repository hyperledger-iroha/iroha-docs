# Peer Management

If you followed any of the language-specific guides, you now have a
well-functioning network that people will want to join.

## Public Blockchain

In an open network, peer admission is still a chain policy decision. A node
can run the correct software and connect to Torii, but it only participates
in consensus after the network admits its peer identity.

## Private Blockchain

In a bank setting, allowing everyone to join at their leisure is a security
risk. For safety, private Iroha deployments usually pin the peer topology in
configuration and genesis instead of relying on open discovery.

### Registering peers

To add a peer to the network, it must be manually registered. Let's discuss
the steps that should be taken in order to complete this process.

#### 1. Grant the user permissions

The account that registers the peer must have the appropriate `Permission`.
This can be granted through a `Role` or as a direct permission grant.

Grant a role when an account will manage peers over time. Use a direct
permission grant for a one-time registration by an account that does not
otherwise manage peers.

::: info

The default executor uses the `CanManagePeers` permission token for
registering and unregistering peers.

We discuss permissions and roles with more detail in a
[separate chapter](/blockchain/permissions.md).

#### 2. Set up a peer

After a new peer was granted permissions, it must be set up.

Request the current peer configuration before admitting a node. Torii exposes
node parameter and capability endpoints for this purpose. Peer bootstrap does
not negotiate these values automatically: operators must verify that timeouts,
batch sizes, and other consensus-relevant settings match the network.

To simplify the process, you can ask the network administrator for a
redacted version of `config.toml`, which excludes privileged information,
such as peer private keys.

#### 3. Submit the instruction

_After_ your peer is running, you should submit the _register peer_
instruction. The peer will go through the handshake process and start
chatting with the network.

::: tip

Submitting a peer registration instruction **does not** (and cannot)
instantiate a _new peer process_.

### Unregistering peers

What about unregistering peers? For security reasons this process is
one-sided. The network reaches consensus that it wants to remove a peer,
but the peer itself doesn't know much about why nobody's talking to it.

In most circumstances, if you want to unregister a peer, you want to do so
because it is a Byzantine fault. Just "ghosting" this peer makes the life
of the malicious actor on the network harder.
