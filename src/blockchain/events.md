# Events

Events are emitted when certain things happen within the blockchain, e.g. a
new account is created or a block is committed. There are different types
of events:

- pipeline events
- data events
- time events
- trigger execution events

## Pipeline Events

Pipeline events are emitted when transactions are submitted, executed, or
committed to a block. A pipeline event contains the following information:
the kind of entity that caused an event (transaction or block), its hash
and status. The status can be either `Validating` (validation in progress),
`Rejected`, or `Committed`. If an entity was rejected, the reason for the
rejection is provided.

### Try It on Taira

Check that the public pipeline event stream is mounted:

```bash
curl -fsSI https://taira.sora.org/v1/events/sse \
  | sed -n '1,12p'
```

For a snapshot you can inspect without keeping a stream open, read recent
explorer transactions:

```bash
curl -fsS 'https://taira.sora.org/v1/explorer/transactions?page=1&per_page=5' \
  | jq '{pagination, txs: [.items[] | {hash, block, status, executable}]}'
```

Open the SSE route in a terminal when you need live events:

```bash
curl -fsS -N https://taira.sora.org/v1/events/sse
```

If no transactions are submitted while the stream is open, the command can stay
quiet even though the route is healthy.

## Data Events

Data events are emitted when there is a change related to ledger data such
as peers, domains, accounts, assets, asset definitions, NFTs, triggers,
roles, on-chain configuration, executor state, proofs, confidential assets,
bridges, or SORA/Nexus-specific objects. These types of events are used in
[data event filters](./filters.md#data-event-filters).

## Time Events

Time events are emitted when the world state view is ready to handle
[time triggers](./triggers.md#time-triggers).

## Trigger Execution Events

Trigger execution events are emitted when the
[`ExecuteTrigger`](./instructions.md#executetrigger) instruction is
executed. Trigger completion events are emitted after a trigger action
finishes.
